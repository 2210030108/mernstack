                  Every day people are forced from their homes due to fires, storms and other disasters. Single- and multi-family fires account for 90% of disaster responses. You can be part of a team that helps and responds to over 60,000 emergencies every year. From offering a caring and compassionate ear, to meeting the disaster-caused needs of individuals and households, such as lodging and clothing, and connecting them with long term recovery services, our volunteers ensure that families donâ€™t have to face tough times alone.
